#Plz do note Down all the Issues in here.


#1[Fixed]
Naming the ranks in certain format gives this error while uploading the image for Directors & Deans(former).
Eg:
Director(i)
Director(I)
Director(IIT-BHU)

 Storage can not find an available filename for "C:\Users\shiva\Documents\GitHub\iitbhu - Copy (3)\media\images\Directors & Deans\Director(i)\sf_M0Ftj5l.jpg". Please make sure that the corresponding file field allows sufficient "max_length".

*No idea how it fixed itself!!

#2 [FIXED]
index.html
notification panel -> when notification title exceeds one line. -> arrow box fails to cover the required height.

* The issue will not exist in our dyanmic model as the title of notification is fixed to length(100) which will prevent frontend from breaking.
